 1. Closures in JavaScript
Definition:
A closure is a function that retains access to its lexical scope (the variables from its parent function) even after the parent function has finished execution.

Why Are Closures Needed?
Data Encapsulation – Hide implementation details.
Maintaining State – Store data across function calls.
Callback Functions – Used in event listeners, timeouts, and intervals.
How Closures Work?
Closures work because JavaScript follows lexical scoping, meaning inner functions can access variables of their parent functions.
