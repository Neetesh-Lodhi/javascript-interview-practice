//theory points for interview explanation
//variable hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variable declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope during the compile phase.
//This means that you can access a variable before it is declared in the code.
//In the example below, the variable `b` is accessed before it is declared, but it still works because of hoisting.
//However, this only works with variable declarations, not with variable assignments.
//Variable declarations are hoisted, but variable assignments are not hoisted.
